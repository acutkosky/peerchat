# peerchat

Really simple chat application that uses [peerjs](www.peerjs.com) to transmit text peer-to-peer. 
All you need is some client side javascript!

To use this, get a peerjs api key and put it in `peerchat.html` in the indicated line, then you and friend
can chat using the extremely beautiful UI just by loading the html file in a modern browser.
